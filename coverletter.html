        <!--Greeting -->
        <h4><b>Hello Service Desk Leadership,</b></h4> 
        <!--Message -->
        <p>When I heard about the position for Team Lead I was ecstatic. In the past few months I have learned a lot of the 
            job of a Tier 1 agent, and working hand in hand with several other key players on the service desk, I have been trying 
            to approach my coworkers as both a servant leader as well as a good friend. I have been eager for an opportunity to grow and 
            better reach my fellow co-workers on a broader scale. Since I started, I have only tried to be a resource and I have a 
            desire to use this position to become a better resource for my peers. I would use this position in any way possible to serve 
            the needs of our students, staff, and most importantly my fellow teammates. I know that I am fit for this position because 
            I am approachable, quick to correct my faults, and have a determination to solve problems when they arise.</p>
        
        <p>I look forward to hearing back from you,</p>
        
        <p>Respectfully,</p>

        <p><b>Austin Engle</b></p>
